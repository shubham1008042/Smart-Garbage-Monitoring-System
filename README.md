# Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-System

Garbage may consist of the unwanted material left over from City, Public area, Society, College, home etc. This project is related to the “Smart City- Clean City” and based on “Internet of Things” (IoT). So for smart lifestyle, cleanliness is needed, and cleanliness is begins with Garbage Bin.This project will help to eradicate or minimize the garbage disposal problem. The Internet of Things ( IoT ) is a recent communication paradigm that envisions near future, in which the objects of everyday life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will make them able to communicate with one another and with the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet. This project IoT Garbage Monitoring system is a very innovative system which will help to keep the cities clean.

This system monitors the garbage bins and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins via a web page. For this the system uses ultrasonic sensors placed over the bins to detect the garbage level and compare it with the garbage bins depth. The system makes use of Arduino family micro-controller, Wi-Fi modem for sending data. The Web-Applicaton is used to display the status of the level of garbage collected in the bins. Whereas a web page is built to show the status to the user monitoring it. The web page gives a graphical view of the garbage bins and highlights the garbage collected in color in order to show the level of garbage collected. The gauge shows the status of the garbage level. Thus this system helps to keep the city clean by informing about the garbage levels of the bins by providing graphical image of the bins via a web page.
